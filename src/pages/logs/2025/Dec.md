# Advent of Code

Every year (since 2023), I try to finish the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) challenge. Every year I lose the motivation as I reach the middle of the month.

As of writing this blog (2nd Jan 2026), I have 3 more challenges to complete.

In addition to completing the challenge, I want to complete all the questions in Rust. My advent of code github repository is currently marked as a python repository. By completing year 2025’s challenge in Rust, Rust should become the top language.

Progress update—as of 2nd Jan 2026—my advent of code repository is marked as a rust repository.

## Writing Tablet

I bought the One by Wacom writing tablet. 

Trying to write on this feels like writing with your left hand in 3rd person view.

My goal with this purchase is to use digital paper (over physical notebooks) to do rough work for my coding projects, like the advent of code challenge. 

This way I can archive all of my rough work digitally, without any extra effort—like taking photo of my rough work book—but still keep it labor intensive enough for optimal performance.

Typing out my though process does not work as a good rough work strategy for me. My typing speed is faster than my brain’s processing power. My writing speed, on the other hand, is slow enough for my brain to process information in the background. Additionally writing mathematical symbols is far easier with a pen over using some system like latex notations.

# Reading

## Shadows of Self

Finished Shadows of self. The ending of the book was average, the reveal at the end was not as explosive as the usual Sanderson endings. I liked harmony’s arc in this book. There are still unexplained parts of the relationship between wax and harmony. Hopefully book 3 will have a better Sanderlanche.

## The Heiress by Rachel Hawkins

Met a stranger at the library. She recommended me The Heiress by Rachel Hawkins. The book was interesting. Pacing was awesome, but the ending was not explosive enough for a thriller book.
