This style of writing mothly blog is heavily inspired from [Tom7](http://tom7.org/)'s page. I want to have a public forum where I can post my thoughts.

I have been reading a few books.

Days at the Morisaki Bookshop by Satoshi Yagisawa. Its a small chill novel. The setting of the book is quite nice if you have always been a book lover.

    Art of Bullsh*tting (and being good at it) by Agrim Prakash

Then I read The Art of Bullsh*tting (and being good at it) by Agrim Prakash. I have attended a few lectures by Agrim during my college orrientateion week. He is a very fun guy and the book is on brand. A few chapters in the end gets into a deeper levels of bullshitting. The writing style is quite engaging and you can churn through the pages quite fast.

I am still reading through elantris. Almost half way through. Thats when I got distracted with Days at the Morisaki Bookshop and The Art of Bullshitting.

    The Secret of Secrets by Dan Brown

I have picked up Dan Brown's latest The Secret of Secrets also. Its really fun read till now. The chapters are short and tight. I am really enjoying his writing style. [Darshan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darshan-jayachandran-39804018b/) recomended checkingout Sherlock holmes books if I am liking this style of books. Maybe ill pick something up after I go through my Cosmere backlog.
